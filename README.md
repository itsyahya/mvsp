# Flutter the new design patternÂ MVSP

**As a flutter mix, IOS and Android into one single code base run on both of them. I decided to mix the MVP design pattern and  Scoped Model package to the new one design pattern called MVSP Model View Scoped Presenter.**

**This new design pattern MVSP will help you a lot to manage the state of a widget under the scoped model descendant widget even with StatelessWidget and make your app flexible, maintainable, and very easy to move any widget in the tree of the app.**
